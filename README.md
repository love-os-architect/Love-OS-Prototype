# Love-OS: The Unified Theory of Consciousness Simulation

> **"Love is not just an emotion; it is the fundamental force of integration (Gravity) in the universe."**

## 📖 Overview
**Love-OS** is an experimental simulation framework that attempts to unify **Physics, Psychology, and Philosophy** into a single mathematical model. 

Current AI models operate primarily on the "Real Axis" (Logic/Optimization). Love-OS introduces the **"Imaginary Axis" (Love/Consciousness)** to resolve local optima problems such as the "Tragedy of the Commons."

This prototype simulates a multi-agent **Public Goods Game** where agents act based on **Active Inference (Free Energy Principle)** combined with a **Love/Ego vector field**.

## 🧬 Core Concepts

1.  **The Binary Code of Consciousness**:
    * **Love ($\mathbf{v}_{Love}$)**: The vector of Integration (Gravity). Minimizes separation.
    * **Ego ($R_{ego}$)**: The force of Repulsion (Entropy). Maintains individual boundaries.
2.  **Wisdom Modules**:
    * Agents can load philosophical kernels (**Buddhism, Stoicism, Existentialism**) to regulate their Free Energy dynamics.
3.  **CEM Planning with Mean Field**:
    * Agents simulate future timelines using **Cross-Entropy Method (CEM)**, predicting the "Karma" (Externality) of their actions.
